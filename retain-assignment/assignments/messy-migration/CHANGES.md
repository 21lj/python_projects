# CHANGES.md

## üöÄ Overview
This project is a complete refactor of a legacy Flask + SQLite user management API into a modern, production-ready **FastAPI** stack. The goal was to preserve functionality while improving **security**, **code quality**, **structure**, and **maintainability**.

## üîç Critical Issues Identified

| Category        | Problem                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå Security     | - SQL Injection due to raw queries<br>- Passwords stored as plain text<br>- No input validation or sanitation |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Quality | - Single-file monolithic structure<br>- Tightly coupled logic and routing<br>- No error handling<br>- No consistent status codes |
| üîß Maintainability | - No separation of concerns<br>- Hard to test, debug, or extend<br>- Logic, data, and transport layers intermixed |

## üß± Architecture Decisions

- Chose **FastAPI** for its automatic docs, type-checking, and async readiness.
- Used **SQLAlchemy ORM** for safe and scalable DB interactions.
- Employed **Pydantic** for request/response validation and parsing.
- Passwords are now securely stored using **bcrypt** via `passlib`.
- All database interactions routed through a **CRUD abstraction layer**.
- Routes isolated into modular **routers** for maintainability and scalability.

---

## üîÅ Trade-offs / Assumptions

- Chose SQLite for simplicity; for production, migrate to PostgreSQL or similar.
- Authentication was kept minimal (username/password check); JWT or OAuth can be added if required.
- No frontend/UI was added, in line with challenge guidelines.
- Did not aim for 100% test coverage due to scope constraints.

---

## üß† If I Had More Time

- Add JWT-based token auth for login sessions.
- Add pagination and sorting for user listing.
- Add proper unit and integration tests with `pytest`.
- Containerize with Docker + `.env` file for configuration.
- Add async support to DB calls via `async SQLAlchemy` or `Tortoise ORM`.

## ü§ñ AI Usage Disclosure

- **Tool Used:** ChatGPT (GPT-4)
- **Purpose:** Refactoring strategy, module design, security improvements, and code generation
- **Edits:** All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and in some cases rewritten to improve clarity or efficiency.
